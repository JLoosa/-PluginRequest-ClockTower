# -PluginRequest-ClockTower
A simplified but functional version of the plugin requested in: https://bukkit.org/threads/ok-so-this-might-be-a-little-difficult.438834/#post-3457682

I would like to ask anyone who has experience with coding things similar to the vanilla minecraft @a, @p, @e, @r, etc operators to please offer assistance in making this work fulling. I will consider pull requests and other forms of input as I feel learning how to do this will help OP as well an provide me with more experience as a developer.
